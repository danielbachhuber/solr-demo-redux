Use WP-CLI to generate a one-time login URL for any user

== Description ==

Need access to a WordPress install but don't want to create a new user account? Use this plugin and WP-CLI to generate a one-time login URL for any existing user:

    wp plugin install one-time-login --activate && wp user one-time-login <user>

After you run the command above, you'll see a success message like this:

    Success: Your one-time login URL is: http://wp.dev/wp-login.php?user_id=1&one_time_login_token=eb6f4de94323e589addb9ad3391883e1d6233bc3

Copy the URL, paste it into your web browser, and... voila!

Because it's a one-time login URL, it will only work once. If you need access again, you'll need to run the WP-CLI command again.
